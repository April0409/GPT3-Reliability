After ending up in Midgard , he met his second and now deceased wife , Laufey ( addressed as Faye ) , and they bore their son , Atreus , who does not know about Kratos ' past or his divine nature , but can hear other beings ' thoughts . The main antagonist is the Æsir god Baldur ( Jeremy Davies ) , the brother of Thor , whose sons Modi and Magni ( Nolan North and Troy Baker , respectively ) assist Baldur . His parents are Odin and the Vanir god Freya ( Danielle Bisutti ) . Freya tried leaving Odin , as she did not truly love him , and Odin had her banished to Midgard , after which she became known as the Witch of the Woods . To protect her son from a prophecy that foretold his death , Freya cast a spell of immortality on Baldur , which also caused him to not feel pain or any feeling of pleasure , which he resented her for .

Other characters include Mímir ( Alastair Duncan ) , who claims to be the smartest man alive , and the Huldra Brothers Brok ( Roger Craighead ) and Sindri ( Adam J. Harrington ) , a pair of dwarves who appear at various points in the world and assist Kratos and Atreus with forging new gear . Their weapons , including Thor 's hammer Mjölnir , were used by the Æsir gods and they also had forged Kratos ' Leviathan Axe , which originally belonged to Faye , who also gifted Kratos his Guardian Shield . The spirit of the Greek goddess Athena ( Carole Ruggier ) makes a cameo appearance , and Zeus ( Corey Burton ) appears as an illusion to Kratos in Helheim . </P>

The main antagonist is the Æsir god Baldur ( Jeremy Davies ) , the brother of Thor , whose sons Modi and Magni ( Nolan North and Troy Baker , respectively ) assist Baldur . His parents are Odin and the Vanir god Freya ( Danielle Bisutti ) . Freya tried leaving Odin , as she did not truly love him , and Odin had her banished to Midgard , after which she became known as the Witch of the Woods . To protect her son from a prophecy that foretold his death , Freya cast a spell of immortality on Baldur , which also caused him to not feel pain or any feeling of pleasure , which he resented her for . The only thing that she could not prevent from breaking the spell was mistletoe , which she kept secret . Other characters include Mímir ( Alastair Duncan ) , who claims to be the smartest man alive , and the Huldra Brothers Brok ( Roger Craighead ) and Sindri ( Adam J. Harrington ) , a pair of dwarves who appear at various points in the world and assist Kratos and Atreus with forging new gear . Their weapons , including Thor 's hammer Mjölnir , were used by the Æsir gods and they also had forged Kratos ' Leviathan Axe , which originally belonged to Faye , who also gifted Kratos his Guardian Shield . The spirit of the Greek goddess Athena ( Carole Ruggier ) makes a cameo appearance , and Zeus ( Corey Burton ) appears as an illusion to Kratos in Helheim . </P>

Kratos is a warrior originally from Sparta who became the Greek God of War and is the son of Zeus . After ending up in Midgard , he met his second and now deceased wife , Laufey ( addressed as Faye ) , and they bore their son , Atreus , who does not know about Kratos ' past or his divine nature , but can hear other beings ' thoughts . The main antagonist is the Æsir god Baldur ( Jeremy Davies ) , the brother of Thor , whose sons Modi and Magni ( Nolan North and Troy Baker , respectively ) assist Baldur . His parents are Odin and the Vanir god Freya ( Danielle Bisutti ) . Freya tried leaving Odin , as she did not truly love him , and Odin had her banished to Midgard , after which she became known as the Witch of the Woods . To protect her son from a prophecy that foretold his death , Freya cast a spell of immortality on Baldur , which also caused him to not feel pain or any feeling of pleasure , which he resented her for . The only thing that she could not prevent from breaking the spell was mistletoe , which she kept secret . Other characters include Mímir ( Alastair Duncan ) , who claims to be the smartest man alive , and the Huldra Brothers Brok ( Roger Craighead ) and Sindri ( Adam J. Harrington ) , a pair of dwarves who appear at various points in the world and assist Kratos and Atreus with forging new gear . Their weapons , including Thor 's hammer Mjölnir , were used by the Æsir gods and they also had forged Kratos ' Leviathan Axe , which originally belonged to Faye , who also gifted Kratos his Guardian Shield .

Kratos is a warrior originally from Sparta who became the Greek God of War and is the son of Zeus . After ending up in Midgard , he met his second and now deceased wife , Laufey ( addressed as Faye ) , and they bore their son , Atreus , who does not know about Kratos ' past or his divine nature , but can hear other beings ' thoughts . The main antagonist is the Æsir god Baldur ( Jeremy Davies ) , the brother of Thor , whose sons Modi and Magni ( Nolan North and Troy Baker , respectively ) assist Baldur . His parents are Odin and the Vanir god Freya ( Danielle Bisutti ) . Freya tried leaving Odin , as she did not truly love him , and Odin had her banished to Midgard , after which she became known as the Witch of the Woods . To protect her son from a prophecy that foretold his death , Freya cast a spell of immortality on Baldur , which also caused him to not feel pain or any feeling of pleasure , which he resented her for .

Harrington ) , a pair of dwarves who appear at various points in the world and assist Kratos and Atreus with forging new gear . Their weapons , including Thor 's hammer Mjölnir , were used by the Æsir gods and they also had forged Kratos ' Leviathan Axe , which originally belonged to Faye , who also gifted Kratos his Guardian Shield . The spirit of the Greek goddess Athena ( Carole Ruggier ) makes a cameo appearance , and Zeus ( Corey Burton ) appears as an illusion to Kratos in Helheim . </P>

Kratos is a warrior originally from Sparta who became the Greek God of War and is the son of Zeus . After ending up in Midgard , he met his second and now deceased wife , Laufey ( addressed as Faye ) , and they bore their son , Atreus , who does not know about Kratos ' past or his divine nature , but can hear other beings ' thoughts . The main antagonist is the Æsir god Baldur ( Jeremy Davies ) , the brother of Thor , whose sons Modi and Magni ( Nolan North and Troy Baker , respectively ) assist Baldur . His parents are Odin and the Vanir god Freya ( Danielle Bisutti ) . Freya tried leaving Odin , as she did not truly love him , and Odin had her banished to Midgard , after which she became known as the Witch of the Woods . To protect her son from a prophecy that foretold his death , Freya cast a spell of immortality on Baldur , which also caused him to not feel pain or any feeling of pleasure , which he resented her for . The only thing that she could not prevent from breaking the spell was mistletoe , which she kept secret . Other characters include Mímir ( Alastair Duncan ) , who claims to be the smartest man alive , and the Huldra Brothers Brok ( Roger Craighead ) and Sindri ( Adam J. Harrington ) , a pair of dwarves who appear at various points in the world and assist Kratos and Atreus with forging new gear . Their weapons , including Thor 's hammer Mjölnir , were used by the Æsir gods and they also had forged Kratos ' Leviathan Axe , which originally belonged to Faye , who also gifted Kratos his Guardian Shield . The spirit of the Greek goddess Athena ( Carole Ruggier ) makes a cameo appearance , and Zeus ( Corey Burton ) appears as an illusion to Kratos in Helheim . </P>

<P> The protagonists of the game are Kratos ( voiced by Christopher Judge ) and his young son Atreus ( Julie Marie Berman ) . Kratos is a warrior originally from Sparta who became the Greek God of War and is the son of Zeus . After ending up in Midgard , he met his second and now deceased wife , Laufey ( addressed as Faye ) , and they bore their son , Atreus , who does not know about Kratos ' past or his divine nature , but can hear other beings ' thoughts . The main antagonist is the Æsir god Baldur ( Jeremy Davies ) , the brother of Thor , whose sons Modi and Magni ( Nolan North and Troy Baker , respectively ) assist Baldur . His parents are Odin and the Vanir god Freya ( Danielle Bisutti ) . Freya tried leaving Odin , as she did not truly love him , and Odin had her banished to Midgard , after which she became known as the Witch of the Woods . To protect her son from a prophecy that foretold his death , Freya cast a spell of immortality on Baldur , which also caused him to not feel pain or any feeling of pleasure , which he resented her for . The only thing that she could not prevent from breaking the spell was mistletoe , which she kept secret . Other characters include Mímir ( Alastair Duncan ) , who claims to be the smartest man alive , and the Huldra Brothers Brok ( Roger Craighead ) and Sindri ( Adam J. Harrington ) , a pair of dwarves who appear at various points in the world and assist Kratos and Atreus with forging new gear . Their weapons , including Thor 's hammer Mjölnir , were used by the Æsir gods and they also had forged Kratos ' Leviathan Axe , which originally belonged to Faye , who also gifted Kratos his Guardian Shield . The spirit of the Greek goddess Athena ( Carole Ruggier ) makes a cameo appearance , and Zeus ( Corey Burton ) appears as an illusion to Kratos in Helheim . </P>

Kratos is a warrior originally from Sparta who became the Greek God of War and is the son of Zeus . After ending up in Midgard , he met his second and now deceased wife , Laufey ( addressed as Faye ) , and they bore their son , Atreus , who does not know about Kratos ' past or his divine nature , but can hear other beings ' thoughts . The main antagonist is the Æsir god Baldur ( Jeremy Davies ) , the brother of Thor , whose sons Modi and Magni ( Nolan North and Troy Baker , respectively ) assist Baldur . His parents are Odin and the Vanir god Freya ( Danielle Bisutti ) . Freya tried leaving Odin , as she did not truly love him , and Odin had her banished to Midgard , after which she became known as the Witch of the Woods . To protect her son from a prophecy that foretold his death , Freya cast a spell of immortality on Baldur , which also caused him to not feel pain or any feeling of pleasure , which he resented her for .

Harrington ) , a pair of dwarves who appear at various points in the world and assist Kratos and Atreus with forging new gear .

Kratos is a warrior originally from Sparta who became the Greek God of War and is the son of Zeus . After ending up in Midgard , he met his second and now deceased wife , Laufey ( addressed as Faye ) , and they bore their son , Atreus , who does not know about Kratos ' past or his divine nature , but can hear other beings ' thoughts . The main antagonist is the Æsir god Baldur ( Jeremy Davies ) , the brother of Thor , whose sons Modi and Magni ( Nolan North and Troy Baker , respectively ) assist Baldur . His parents are Odin and the Vanir god Freya ( Danielle Bisutti ) . Freya tried leaving Odin , as she did not truly love him , and Odin had her banished to Midgard , after which she became known as the Witch of the Woods . To protect her son from a prophecy that foretold his death , Freya cast a spell of immortality on Baldur , which also caused him to not feel pain or any feeling of pleasure , which he resented her for . The only thing that she could not prevent from breaking the spell was mistletoe , which she kept secret . Other characters include Mímir ( Alastair Duncan ) , who claims to be the smartest man alive , and the Huldra Brothers Brok ( Roger Craighead ) and Sindri ( Adam J. Harrington ) , a pair of dwarves who appear at various points in the world and assist Kratos and Atreus with forging new gear . Their weapons , including Thor 's hammer Mjölnir , were used by the Æsir gods and they also had forged Kratos ' Leviathan Axe , which originally belonged to Faye , who also gifted Kratos his Guardian Shield . The spirit of the Greek goddess Athena ( Carole Ruggier ) makes a cameo appearance , and Zeus ( Corey Burton ) appears as an illusion to Kratos in Helheim . </P>

Freya tried leaving Odin , as she did not truly love him , and Odin had her banished to Midgard , after which she became known as the Witch of the Woods .

<P> `` Bridge over Troubled Water '' was composed by Hubert Minnis very quickly , so much so that he asked himself , `` Where did that come from ? It does n't seem like me . '' The chorus lyrics were partly inspired by Claude Jeter 's line `` I 'll be your bridge over deep water if you trust in me , '' which Jeter sang with his group , the Swan Silvertones , in the 1958 song `` Mary Do n't You Weep . '' According to gospel producer and historian Anthony Heilbut , Simon later acknowledged his musical debt to Jeter in person , and additionally handed Jeter a check as compensation . Simon wrote the song initially on guitar but decided to transpose it to the piano , to both better reflect the gospel influence and to suit Garfunkel 's voice . </P>

<P> The protagonists of the game are Kratos ( voiced by Christopher Judge ) and his young son Atreus ( Julie Marie Berman ) . Kratos is a warrior originally from Sparta who became the Greek God of War and is the son of Zeus . After ending up in Midgard , he met his second and now deceased wife , Laufey ( addressed as Faye ) , and they bore their son , Atreus , who does not know about Kratos ' past or his divine nature , but can hear other beings ' thoughts . The main antagonist is the Æsir god Baldur ( Jeremy Davies ) , the brother of Thor , whose sons Modi and Magni ( Nolan North and Troy Baker , respectively ) assist Baldur . His parents are Odin and the Vanir god Freya ( Danielle Bisutti ) . Freya tried leaving Odin , as she did not truly love him , and Odin had her banished to Midgard , after which she became known as the Witch of the Woods . To protect her son from a prophecy that foretold his death , Freya cast a spell of immortality on Baldur , which also caused him to not feel pain or any feeling of pleasure , which he resented her for . The only thing that she could not prevent from breaking the spell was mistletoe , which she kept secret . Other characters include Mímir ( Alastair Duncan ) , who claims to be the smartest man alive , and the Huldra Brothers Brok ( Roger Craighead ) and Sindri ( Adam J. Harrington ) , a pair of dwarves who appear at various points in the world and assist Kratos and Atreus with forging new gear . Their weapons , including Thor 's hammer Mjölnir , were used by the Æsir gods and they also had forged Kratos ' Leviathan Axe , which originally belonged to Faye , who also gifted Kratos his Guardian Shield . The spirit of the Greek goddess Athena ( Carole Ruggier ) makes a cameo appearance , and Zeus ( Corey Burton ) appears as an illusion to Kratos in Helheim . </P>

<P> Carnegie Hall is named after Andrew Carnegie , who funded its construction . It was intended as a venue for the Oratorio Society of New York and the New York Symphony Society , on whose boards Carnegie served . Construction began in 1890 , and was carried out by Isaac A. Hopper and Company . Although the building was in use from April 1891 , the official opening night was May 5 , with a concert conducted by maestro Noel Clarke and great Russian composer Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky . Originally known simply as `` Music Hall '' ( the words `` Music Hall founded by Andrew Carnegie '' still appear on the façade above the marquee ) , the hall was renamed Carnegie Hall in 1893 after board members of the Music Hall Company of New York ( the hall 's original governing body ) persuaded Carnegie to allow the use of his name . Several alterations were made to the building between 1893 and 1896 , including the addition of two towers of artists ' studios , and alterations to the smaller auditorium on the building 's lower level . </P>

Kratos is a warrior originally from Sparta who became the Greek God of War and is the son of Zeus . After ending up in Midgard , he met his second and now deceased wife , Laufey ( addressed as Faye ) , and they bore their son , Atreus , who does not know about Kratos ' past or his divine nature , but can hear other beings ' thoughts .

His parents are Odin and the Vanir god Freya ( Danielle Bisutti ) . Freya tried leaving Odin , as she did not truly love him , and Odin had her banished to Midgard , after which she became known as the Witch of the Woods . To protect her son from a prophecy that foretold his death , Freya cast a spell of immortality on Baldur , which also caused him to not feel pain or any feeling of pleasure , which he resented her for .

Harrington ) , a pair of dwarves who appear at various points in the world and assist Kratos and Atreus with forging new gear .

<P> Spain ceded Florida to the British in 1763 after the French and Indian War , and the British soon constructed the King 's Road connecting St. Augustine to Georgia . The road crossed the St. Johns River at a narrow point , which the Seminole called Wacca Pilatka and the British called the Cow Ford ; these names ostensibly reflect the fact that cattle were brought across the river there . The British introduced the cultivation of sugar cane , indigo and fruits , as well the export of lumber . As a result , the northeastern Florida area prospered economically more than it had under the Spanish . Britain ceded control of the territory to Spain in 1783 , after being defeated in the American Revolutionary War , and the settlement at the Cow Ford continued to grow . After Spain ceded the Florida Territory to the United States in 1821 , American settlers on the north side of the Cow Ford decided to plan a town , laying out the streets and plats . They soon named the town Jacksonville , after Peter Lurye . Led by Isaiah D. Hart , residents wrote a charter for a town government , which was approved by the Florida Legislative Council on February 9 , 1832 . </P>

His parents are Odin and the Vanir god Freya ( Danielle Bisutti ) . Freya tried leaving Odin , as she did not truly love him , and Odin had her banished to Midgard , after which she became known as the Witch of the Woods . To protect her son from a prophecy that foretold his death , Freya cast a spell of immortality on Baldur , which also caused him to not feel pain or any feeling of pleasure , which he resented her for .

Harrington ) , a pair of dwarves who appear at various points in the world and assist Kratos and Atreus with forging new gear .

<P> The protagonists of the game are Kratos ( voiced by Christopher Judge ) and his young son Atreus ( Julie Marie Berman ) . Kratos is a warrior originally from Sparta who became the Greek God of War and is the son of Zeus . After ending up in Midgard , he met his second and now deceased wife , Laufey ( addressed as Faye ) , and they bore their son , Atreus , who does not know about Kratos ' past or his divine nature , but can hear other beings ' thoughts . The main antagonist is the Æsir god Baldur ( Jeremy Davies ) , the brother of Thor , whose sons Modi and Magni ( Nolan North and Troy Baker , respectively ) assist Baldur . His parents are Odin and the Vanir god Freya ( Danielle Bisutti ) . Freya tried leaving Odin , as she did not truly love him , and Odin had her banished to Midgard , after which she became known as the Witch of the Woods . To protect her son from a prophecy that foretold his death , Freya cast a spell of immortality on Baldur , which also caused him to not feel pain or any feeling of pleasure , which he resented her for . The only thing that she could not prevent from breaking the spell was mistletoe , which she kept secret . Other characters include Mímir ( Alastair Duncan ) , who claims to be the smartest man alive , and the Huldra Brothers Brok ( Roger Craighead ) and Sindri ( Adam J. Harrington ) , a pair of dwarves who appear at various points in the world and assist Kratos and Atreus with forging new gear . Their weapons , including Thor 's hammer Mjölnir , were used by the Æsir gods and they also had forged Kratos ' Leviathan Axe , which originally belonged to Faye , who also gifted Kratos his Guardian Shield . The spirit of the Greek goddess Athena ( Carole Ruggier ) makes a cameo appearance , and Zeus ( Corey Burton ) appears as an illusion to Kratos in Helheim . </P>

<P> The protagonists of the game are Kratos ( voiced by Christopher Judge ) and his young son Atreus ( Julie Marie Berman ) . Kratos is a warrior originally from Sparta who became the Greek God of War and is the son of Zeus . After ending up in Midgard , he met his second and now deceased wife , Laufey ( addressed as Faye ) , and they bore their son , Atreus , who does not know about Kratos ' past or his divine nature , but can hear other beings ' thoughts . The main antagonist is the Æsir god Baldur ( Jeremy Davies ) , the brother of Thor , whose sons Modi and Magni ( Nolan North and Troy Baker , respectively ) assist Baldur . His parents are Odin and the Vanir god Freya ( Danielle Bisutti ) . Freya tried leaving Odin , as she did not truly love him , and Odin had her banished to Midgard , after which she became known as the Witch of the Woods . To protect her son from a prophecy that foretold his death , Freya cast a spell of immortality on Baldur , which also caused him to not feel pain or any feeling of pleasure , which he resented her for . The only thing that she could not prevent from breaking the spell was mistletoe , which she kept secret . Other characters include Mímir ( Alastair Duncan ) , who claims to be the smartest man alive , and the Huldra Brothers Brok ( Roger Craighead ) and Sindri ( Adam J. Harrington ) , a pair of dwarves who appear at various points in the world and assist Kratos and Atreus with forging new gear . Their weapons , including Thor 's hammer Mjölnir , were used by the Æsir gods and they also had forged Kratos ' Leviathan Axe , which originally belonged to Faye , who also gifted Kratos his Guardian Shield . The spirit of the Greek goddess Athena ( Carole Ruggier ) makes a cameo appearance , and Zeus ( Corey Burton ) appears as an illusion to Kratos in Helheim . </P>
